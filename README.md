* general guide: [How To Make A Game In C++ & SDL2 From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQzAHcojEKg&list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx)
    * note that I changed some things in my version and mostly follow this guide, but it is not exact.
        1. I'm using CLion IDE with SDL on mingw compiler
        2. I build all my images using Gimp 2
        3. Some of my variable names are different.
